1. Overview~

This plugin allows people to easily access and
manage todo lists for their projects.

You can access Todo lists of specific projects just
by being inside of that git repo. In addition, you
can access a general todo list from any folder.

You can find stable versions of this plugin at: 

https://github.com/jfonseca8/vim-bujo

Feedback and bug reports are welcomed and encouraged.
If you want new features, please do let me know. I
would be honored at the opportunity to make a tool
better.

I built this because I wanted the ease of vim bindings
with the benefits of keeping a todo list on hand. It is
very simple and minimialist.

3. Notes

I am not sure that writing this todo file into the root
directory is the best way to go about it. I have never
made anything like this, and couldn't find resources
that were helpful with how to handle such situations.

If this annoys anyone, please do let me know. I am
happy to change it, and happy to know if there are
better standardized ways to go about this
