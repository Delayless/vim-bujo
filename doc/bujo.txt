This plugin allows people to easily access and
manage a todo list.

Feedback and bug reports are welcomed and encouraged.
If you want new features, please do let me know. I
would be honored at the opportunity to make a tool
better.

I built this because I wanted the ease of vim bindings
with the benefits of keeping a todo list on hand. It is
very simple and minimialist.

3. Notes

I am not sure that writing this todo file into the root
directory is the best way to go about it. I have never
made anything like this, and couldn't find resources
that were helpful with how to handle such situations.

If this annoys anyone, please do let me know. I am
happy to change it, and happy to know if there are
better standardized ways to go about this
